[4/21/24, 11:43:46 AM] ~ Vk: 1. Neurons Required: To determine the number of neurons needed, we sum the inputs and outputs. With 6 inputs and 2 outputs, the total number of neurons required is 6 (inputs) + 2 (outputs) = 8 neurons.

2. Dimensions of Weight Matrix: The weight matrix dimensions for a single-layer neural network are given by the number of neurons in the current layer by the number of neurons in the next layer. In this case, the weight matrix dimensions would be 6 (inputs) x 2 (outputs). The weight matrix would be represented as:
‎[4/21/24, 11:43:47 AM] ~ Vk: ‎image omitted
[4/21/24, 11:43:47 AM] ~ Vk: 3. Activation Function: Since the outputs are limited to the range 0 to 1, a suitable activation function for this scenario could be the sigmoid function or the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function. Both these functions squash the output between 0 and 1.
So, to summarize:

A. 8 neurons are required.
B. The weight matrix dimensions are 6 x 2. The weight matrix would be represented as shown above.
C. Sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent functions could be used as activation functions.

The students appearing for Odd semester (ATKT) University Examination ( I, III, V & VII) commencing on June 3, 2024 must note a change in their Examination Centre Allocation. This centre allocation is only for the exams scheduled on June 3, 4 and 5 (Morning & Evening sessions).

NEW HORIZON SCHOLARS SCHOOL RODAS
Rodas, Gate No: 2, Building 'C'  Hiranandani Estate, Thane West, Thane, Maharashtra 400607    
 
Location Link:https://maps.app.goo.gl/NJPvsX1QVUtWiAug7?g_st=ig

Students must reach the Examination centre 30 minutes before the scheduled time. The students must carry Institute's or any other Government issued photo Identity card. They are further advised to start early and plan their travel route to ensure they reach the exam centre on time. This is due to anticipated traffic congestion on the Ghodbunder road and also disruption in the local train services.

Examinations from June 6, 2024 onwards shall be conducted at our NHITM campus, Anand Nagar, Kasarvadavli, Thane.

You will receive official notification in this regard from the Examination cell.
